# Flight Path Visualization 

A Python script that visualizes flight routes and finds the shortest path between cities using Dijkstra's algorithm. This shows best application of Dijkstra Algorithm .

## Features
- Visualizes flight network as a weighted graph
- Finds shortest path between any two cities
- Highlights the shortest path in red
- Displays distances between cities
